#X text 13 44 csmlTools is a set of abstractions for Pd that allows
for fast prototyping and creation of audio applicatoins such as synthesizers
\, saplers \, audio players \, groove boxes \, etc with Pure data.
The base of all is the mlSetup object.;
#X text 13 124 ----- mlSetup ----- Starts by sending the "init" symbol.
Use [r init] to bang any needed initialization in any patch that conntains
mlSetup. After 500 ms starts the DSP engine. It defines [pd audioIO]
\, define here your channels \, masters and any busses. The default
is 8 channels and 1 stereo master.;
#X text 13 214 ----- mlChannel ----- This abstraction defines a channel
by catching chan\$1 as an input \, controlling its amplitud and panning
and creating VU data sent to vuChan\$1. Amplitud can be controlled
with volChan\$1 symbol and panning can be controlled with panCHan\$1
symbol.;
